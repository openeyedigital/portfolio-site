How To Understand and Interact With This Site (P1 NOTES):
    01. Home.html (Will become the static "Coming Soon" page on the domain, the navigation bar has been intentionally limited to "Bookings" link)
    02. Bio.html (Acting as the 'home page' for the P1 project)
        - This will be a nested/navigable page on the official website (non P1)
    03. Bookings.html (A contact form is hosted here)



Site Objective: 
    01. Post music project ("Nacci") content onto a website in a tasteful and artsy way. 
    02. Create a visually pleasing atmosphere 
    03. Finish V1.0 and turn in as "Project: Portfolio Site (P1)" 
    04. Create new read me with progressive "2.0 Nacci" site
