            <p>In a feedback loop of adventure, music, and love, Nacci and his fans are ready to let the force of the sound
                carry everyone to places they have never been before. With inspirations far afield from music – a painting,
                the weather, a dream – in his craft, Andrew Hardman derivations are difficult to trace. Under the broad structure
                of electronic and bass music, and informed by sound the world over, Nacci finds his best fit in the soundscapes
                of ancient tomorrow. With traction growing stateside, he is set to expand far beyond the transformational
                festivals and tours where he grew the same roots that nourished other famous acts, such as: Tipper, Emancipator,
                and Bonobo. Nacci is breaking through the canopy and into the sun. Come see him fly.
